<h1 id="the-wobbly-table-problem-continued">The Wobbly Table Problem, continued</h1>
<p>In <a href="/wobblytable.html">part 1</a> I described the Wobbly Table problem, and explained how a positive solution follows from Dyson’s theorem:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(g: S^2 \to {\mathbb{R}}\)</span> be a continuous function from the 2-sphere to the real numbers. Then there are two orthogonal diameters of the sphere whose endpoints <span class="math inline">\(\pm x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pm y\)</span> all take the same value of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>In this post I’ll give a proof of Dyson’s theorem. Whereas Dyson’s original proof uses a geometric technique called <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>-sets, my proof uses techniques that might be found in a first course in algebraic topology and follows the style of standard proofs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsuk%E2%80%93Ulam_theorem">Borsuk–Ulam theorem</a>.</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(g: S^2 \to {\mathbb{R}}\)</span> be a continuous function from the 2-sphere to the real numbers. We’re interested in the value of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> on 4-tuples of points which are the endpoints of two orthogonal diameters, so we’ll define a function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, associated with <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, which records the value of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> on four points of a square at once.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(h: SO(3) \to {\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span> take the set of <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span> orthogonal matrices to Euclidean 4-space, defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ h([v_1, v_2, v_3]) = (g(v_1), g(v_2), g(-v_1), g(-v_2)) \]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\([v_1, v_2, v_3]\)</span> is a matrix expressed in terms of its column vectors. The vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2, -v_1, -v_2\)</span> form the vertices of a square, and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> records the values of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> on this square (see the picture).</p>
<style>
#labeledsquare {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
#squarepic {
    flex: 1 0 auto;
    width: 20em;
}
#hmap {
}
</style>
<div id="labeledsquare">
<div id="squarepic">
<img src="/assets/labeledsquare.png" />
</div>
<div id="hmap">
<span class="math inline">\(\overset{h}{\longrightarrow} (g(\color{red}{A}), g(\color{blue}{B}), g(\color{darkgreen}{C}), g(D))\)</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we make two observations. First, the function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> has symmetry: it’s keeping track of labels on the vertices of the squares, but if we rotate the square, the value of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> on that different square is related to the value of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> on the original square. We express this symmetry as equivariance with respect to a group action, which we now explain.</p>
<p>The group of symmetries of a square is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group">dihedral group</a> <span class="math inline">\(D_4\)</span> (of order 8). This group has a representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho: D_4 \to SO(3)\)</span> as standard rotation matrices (as the symmetries of a square with vertices at the first two standard basis vectors and their negatives).</p>
<p>The group <span class="math inline">\(D_4\)</span> also acts on <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span> by permuting coordinate factors. Think of the four coordinate factors of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span> as being labeled by the vertices <span class="math inline">\(A, B, C, D\)</span> of a square; then, applying a symmetry of a square permutes the labels.</p>
<p>Therefore we can express the equivariance of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ h([v_1, v_2, v_3] \cdot \rho(a)) = h([v_1, v_2, v_3]) \cdot a, \forall a \in D_4.\]</span></p>
<p>Second, phrased in terms of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, Dyson’s theorem is equivalent to saying that the image of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> intersects the diagonal of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\triangle {\mathbb{R}}^4 = \{ (x,x,x,x) : x \in {\mathbb{R}}\}\)</span>. If Dyson’s theorem failed to hold for a given function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, then the function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> could be deformed so that its image lies in the unit 2-sphere in the 3-space orthogonal to <span class="math inline">\(\triangle {\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span>. In the picture below, we show the diagonal in <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span> as well as the 2-sphere which lies orthogonal to it. Note that we show a 3-dimensional analogue: we have the diagonal pictured in <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}^3\)</span>, with a 1-sphere (a circle) in the complementary 2-plane to the diagonal. In 4 dimensions, there is actually a 2-sphere lying in the complementary 3-space to the diagonal.</p>

</figure>
<p>Furthermore, this deformation remains equivariant: now <span class="math inline">\(D_4\)</span> permutes the vertices of a regular tetrahedron in <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> rather than permuting the coordinates in <span class="math inline">\({\mathbb{R}}^4\)</span>.</p>
<p>After these two observations, Dyson’s theorem will follow from:</p>
<div class="theorem lemma">
<p>There is no <span class="math inline">\(D_4\)</span>–equivariant continuous function from <span class="math inline">\(SO(3)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>, where the group acts on <span class="math inline">\(SO(3)\)</span> by right multiplication and on <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> by permuting the vertices of a regular tetrahedron.</p>
</div>
<p>The proof of this lemma will appear in part 3. Stay tuned!</p>
