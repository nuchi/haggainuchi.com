<p>I’m a senior software engineer specializing in robotics and computer vision. I have a wide range of experience and interests, including machine learning operations, machine perception, multi-object tracking, machine learning applications to audio, computational geometry, and research mathematics (among other things).</p>
<p>I’m currently exploring new opportunities in the San Francisco area or remotely. I’m interested in working on problems related to novel applications of robots. I love solving challenging and novel mathematical problems. I enjoy mentoring junior engineers, and creating positive welcoming environments where everyone is free to ask questions is very important to me.</p>
<p>Other things I’d enjoy working on are sensor fusion, applications of machine learning to medicine, and digital signal processing. I have a PhD in differential geometry and would love to work on something related to that, if you happen to have a problem related to that field! Send me an email at <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#103;&#97;&#105;&#110;&#117;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#103;&#97;&#105;&#110;&#117;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>. See below for some highlighted work experience. For the keyword searchers, I have expertise in Python, C++, sensor fusion, robotics, Tensorflow, macOS, Linux, bash, geometry, mathematics, AWS, opencv, radar tracking, .</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>From Spring 2022 to present, I’ve been working as a robotics software engineer for a small consultancy (no web presence) doing <strong>computer vision algorithms, software architecture design and implementation, planning and prioritization</strong> among other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Summer 2021, <strong>I helped a small startup improve their ML model deployment process.</strong> Their process involved three change sets touching ~20 files to release an updated version of a search ranking model, and took at least 4 hours start-to-finish. I refactored their code and suggested and implemented a candidate-generation and reranking system. The result was that they could update their model with a 1-line change to a single file and only a few minutes of time, which allowed them to iterate and test and deploy changes much more quickly, as well as enabling contributions from data scientists who weren’t deeply familiar with the code base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In November and December 2020, I did pro bono work <strong>tracking and counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnia_magna"><em>Daphnia magna</em></a> specimens in tanks of water from video.</strong> You can see the <a href="https://github.com/nuchi/multi_object_tracking">code and documentation here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a <strong>software engineer at Airbnb</strong> from October 2018 to October 2020. I did machine learning for search ranking at first, and then moved to working on the machine learning platform (tools/ops platform for ML engineers at Airbnb). The latter project’s <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/bighead">github page</a> will eventually become public but is (as of this writing) still private. My contributions there were under <a href="https://github.com/nuchi-airbnb">my work github profile</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Spring 2018 I shared my project <a href="https://humantoanimal.com/"><strong>translating human sounds to dog barks entirely in the browser</strong></a>. It works by compiling a Tensorflow model to WebAssembly. I’ve shared some of the details of how it works in that link, and you can try it out, all in the browser!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Fall 2017 I did some mathematical thinking on the <a href="/wobblytable.html">Wobbly Table problem</a> and the <a href="/inscribedintro.html">Square Peg conjecture</a>. I was introduced to the Wobbly Table problem by some former colleagues at Cruise Automation and it got my attention. I hadn’t done math in a few years and was excited to return to it after leaving my job at Cruise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Spring 2016 to Summer 2017, I was a <strong>software engineer at Cruise Automation</strong> working on autonomous driving. I was tech lead for the Prediction team (writing algorithms and code that runs on the autonomous cars and predicts where other drivers/cyclists/pedestrians will go, supervising interns, coordinating with other teams, making sure the software met latency requirements, etc), and also worked on multi-object tracking and sensor fusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to working as a software engineer, I got my <strong>PhD from UPenn and worked as a postdoc at the University of Toronto, in mathematics</strong>. My research focus was in differential geometry, in particular around Hopf fibrations and related objects.</p>
</li>

<p>I’d be happy to hear from you if anything here catches your interest! If you check out <a href="writings.html">the stuff I’ve written</a> and you like it, send me a note at <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#103;&#97;&#105;&#110;&#117;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#104;&#97;&#103;&#103;&#97;&#105;&#110;&#117;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>. Thanks to a recent reader who read some of my work on the Square Peg conjecture and who wrote to me to inform me that there has been some progress made in the past few years, with some researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09193">solving the smooth rectangular peg problem</a>!</p>
